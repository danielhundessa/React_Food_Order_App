<p>
    React Context is a way to manage state globally.
    
    It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state 
    between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.

   WHY REACT CONTEXT?
   If we have many nested components and if the component at the top and 
   bottom need access to the state we will need to pass the state as
   props through EACH nested component and this is called PROP DRILLING to
   AVOID THIS ISSUE we use create Context.

   To create context it must be imported using createContext and
   inizialize it.


   use the Context Provider to wrap the tree of components that need
   the state Context.

   Wrap child components in the Context Provider and supply the state value.


          <p>React useReducer Hook</p>
  useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.
  for multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic useReducer is 
  better solution

  SYNTAX
  useReducer Hook accepts two arguments
  useReducer (<reducer>, <initialState>)

    The reducer function contains custom state logic and the initialState
    The useReducer Hook returns the current state and a dispatch method.

The reducer function specifies how the state gets updated.takes the state
and action arguments and should return next state.

useReducer returns an array with exactly two values.
the current state which during first render sets to <initailState>
    the dispatch function lets to update the state to a different 
    value and trigger re-render.

    You need to pass the action as the only argument to the dispatch
    function. 

    React will set the next state to the result of calling the reducer
    function provided with the current state and the action passed to 
    dispatch.

    dispatch functions do not have a return value.
    dispatch function only updates the state variable for the next render

import { useReducer } from 'react';
