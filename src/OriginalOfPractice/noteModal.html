<p>  CREATE PORTAL
    createPortal lets you render some chidren into a different part of the DOM.
    To create a portal, call createPortal, passing some JSX, and 
    the DOM node where it should be rendered:

   USEREF
<P>
    The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
    It can be used to access a DOM element directly.
    It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause
     a re-render when updated.

     If we tried to count how many times our application renders using the 
     useState Hook,
     we would be caught in an infinite loop since this Hook itself causes 
     a re-render.
     To avoid this, we can use the useRef Hook.
     useRef() only returns one item. It returns an Object called current.
     
     When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: useRef(0).
     In React, we can add a ref attribute to an element to access it 
     directly in the DOM.

    useEffect
<p>
    useEffect is a React Hook that lets you synchronize a component 
    with an external system.
    useEffect(setup, dependencies?)
    useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.

    useEffect runs on every render. That means that when the count changes, 
    a render happens, which then triggers another effect.
